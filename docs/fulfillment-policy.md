# Fulfillment Policy

_Last Updated: June 2025_

At Arcturus Labs, we provide high-quality, customized AI consulting services. Our offerings include strategic assessments, training, and prototyping, all tailored to the client’s needs and delivered remotely, asynchronously, or in person. This policy outlines how engagements are fulfilled, and how cancellations and refunds are handled.

---

## 1. Service Delivery

All services are delivered under individually negotiated contracts. Each agreement includes a clear description of the engagement process, deliverables, and timelines. Clients are provided with this information before work begins.

---

## 2. Refund Policy

- Clients may cancel with at least seven (7) calendar days’ notice prior to the scheduled start of work for an invoicing period. In such cases, the associated invoice will be canceled and no work will be performed.
- If a client cancels after an invoice has been paid, no refund will be issued except in exigent circumstances (serious illness, natural disaster, or similar unforeseen hardship). In such cases, a partial refund may be considered for undelivered work or unused time.
- If Arcturus Labs must cancel a project, a full refund will be issued for any undelivered services.
- If a client is dissatisfied with the results, we do not offer refunds, but we typically provide a course correction or follow-up session to address concerns.

## 3. Cancellations & Rescheduling

The same cancellation policy applies to both project-based and retainer-based work. Clients may cancel with at least seven (7) calendar days’ notice prior to the scheduled start of work for an invoicing period. Rescheduling of individual sessions requires reasonable notice (24-48 hours) and will be accommodated as availability allows.
