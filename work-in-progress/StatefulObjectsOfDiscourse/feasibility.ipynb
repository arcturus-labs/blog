    "# Goal - Create conversation with artifacts\n",
    "- Artifacts are presented in the system message (along with their history eventually)\n",
    "- Artifacts are referenced in the conversation by their nickname\n",
    "- Artifacts can be edited by the AI by rewriting their content (need to use Claude so that I can present this with XML tags)\n",
    "- Users can modify artifacts directly and the changes are reflected in the conversation\n",
    "- Demo CRUD\n",
    "  - User creates artifact by requesting it - user deletes artifact\n",
    "  - User retrieves artifact by requesting it\n",
    "- Demo relationship between artifacts\n",
    "- Demo anchors in artifacts?\n",

    "## Scenario\n",
    "A realestate agent is gathering information about a property so they can send an email to a prospective buyer.\n",
    "```python\n",
    "c.say(\"Find the listing for 742 Maple Street\") # retrieve artifact\n",
    "c.say(\"Are there any comparable properties nearby?\"); # retrieve artifact\n",
    "c.say(\"Oops, there's an error in the listing. That address is actually 740 Maple Street. Fix it.\"); # edit artifact\n",
    "c.say(\"lets grab that template - I need to email Bob Sircy about this property.\"); # retrieve artifact  \n",
    "c.say(\"Can you create an email using that template for Bob Sircy for the property at 740 Maple Street?\"); # create artifact\n",
    "c.say(\"Oops, you forgot to sign it. My name is John Berryman. Can you add my name to the email?\"); # edit artifact\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "## TODOs\n",
    "- [ ] Gut my demo app and make it have the simplest possible frontend and backend\n",
    "- [ ] Fork it and make it implement the scenario above\n",
    "  - [ ] The API should take the full conversation history as input, not just the last message and the artifacts and return the updated conversation history and artifacts\n",
    "  - [ ] The dumb version of this will return no artifacts\n"
