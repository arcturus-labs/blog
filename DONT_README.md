## TODO
- [ ] The [blog page](http://127.0.0.1:8000/blog/) just lists all of the posts in full text - figure out some way to make it easier to see what posts exist.
  - Titles only, and unfoldable content?
  - Table of contents on the side like the actual blogs have?
- [ ] Change theme
  - [ ] Figure out how to syntax highlight code
  - [ ] Figure out how to make my headings clickable links
- [ ] Get MathJax set up
