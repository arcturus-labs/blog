# Silly stuff John will forget

## Deployment
- Now using GitHub Actions for automatic deployment
- Push to `main` branch triggers automatic build and deployment to GitHub Pages
- No need for manual scripts - everything is automated!

## Reminders
- The text I like for Arcturus Labs is Raleway

## refs
- https://www.mkdocs.org/getting-started/
- https://www.mkdocs.org/user-guide/ 
- https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/reference/

## TODO! for each blog post
- make a demo
- make an outline (consider using /Users/johnberryman/Dropbox/Notebooks/work/arcturus-internal/blog_composer/blog_composer.ipynb)
- write it
  - make sure the description in the heading is correct
  - make sure image looks good – see what it looks like when shared https://socialsharepreview.com/
  - make sure that lists and headings all work
  - Figure out how to link other posts into this one and this post into others (look for TODOs)
  - add an image (make sure to add it to the image metadata at the top of the post)
  - add a `<!-- more -->` tag to separate preview text from the full text of the post
- youtube video (incorporate into text)
  - open new browser with that blog post in full screen (w/o menus)
  - open quicktime
  - create new screen recording and shrink the window as much as possible, in View make "float on top"
  - create new movie recording
  - record summary
  - upload you youtube https://studio.youtube.com/channel/UChBzAOm4bnuBWmvI8PDT79g/videos/upload?d=ud&filter=%5B%5D&sort=%7B%22columnType%22%3A%22date%22%2C%22sortOrder%22%3A%22DESCENDING%22%7D
  - Add a callout for the video to the post
- update Blog Post Categories below
- git commit
- git push (triggers automatic deployment via GitHub Actions)
- share w/ close friends for feedback – always get someone different each time - add their names to the bottom
- share X/bluesky/linked-in/? (maybe with https://typefully.com/)
- direct ping individuals
- run the cursor command /generate-arcturus-newsletter, create a new broadcast in kit.com using the arcturus template. Replace the content with `/html` and past in the html

## DONE
